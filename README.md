- View all student records in tabular format  
- Update student GPA using Roll Number  
- Delete student record by Roll Number  
- Ensures unique Roll Numbers using constraints  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (prototype in Colab)  
- **SQLite3** → database storage  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter** for execution
